TwitterDataset-Analysis
=======================

Twitter Dataset Analysis and Modeling.


The objective of this project is to analyze and compare performances for accessing a large twitter dataset. The dataset consists of three collections:

1) Profile 
2) Networks and 
3) Tweets

The goal is to define at least two different data models (of MongoDB) in which the twitter data would be ingested. Then performance evaluation would be conducted for analysis, update and querying of both these data models.
